## 📁 Key Files Modified/Created

### 1. **Frontend: `apps/main/src/pages/AISpeakingCall.tsx`**
**Purpose:** Main UI component for real-time voice calling

**Key Features:**
- Hybrid speech recognition setup
- Auto-restart logic for continuous listening
- Fallback detection (network error → Google Cloud)
- Real-time UI updates (listening → thinking → speaking)
- Debug logs for troubleshooting
- Pronunciation score display

**Core State:**
```typescript
callState: 'idle' | 'listening' | 'thinking' | 'speaking' | 'error'
speechMode: 'web-speech' | 'google-cloud' | 'none'
transcript: { speaker, text, pronunciation? }[]
livePartial: string  // interim results
```

**Key Functions:**
- `handleStudentTranscript()` → Process student speech
- `startCall()` → Initialize conversation
- `endCall()` → Cleanup and teardown

---

### 2. **Backend: `apps/main/supabase/functions/gemini-ielts-coach/index.ts`**
**Purpose:** AI coaching response generation + pronunciation analysis

**Two Parallel Gemini Calls:**

**Call 1 - Coaching Response:**
- Takes student transcript
- Analyzes with IELTS band descriptors (Fluency, Lexical Resource, Grammatical Accuracy, Pronunciation)
- Returns 1-2 sentence coaching feedback

**Call 2 - Pronunciation Analysis:**
```json
{
  "score": 1-10,
  "areas": {
    "pronunciation": "phonetic accuracy (0-5)",
    "intonation": "rising/falling patterns (0-5)",
    "stress": "word and sentence stress (0-5)",
    "accent": "native vs non-native analysis (0-5)"
  },
  "feedback": "1-sentence improvement tip",
  "positive": "1-sentence what went well"
}
```

---

### 3. **TTS: `apps/main/supabase/functions/google-tts-speech/index.ts`**
**Purpose:** Convert AI response text to natural speech audio

**Features:**
- Neural2 voice (professional, natural)
- Base64-encoded MP3 output
- Configurable speaking rate and pitch
- Supports SSML for advanced control

---

### 4. **Session Logging: `apps/main/supabase/functions/ai-speaking-session-log/index.ts`**
**Purpose:** Track session data for analytics and cost estimation

**Logs:**
- Duration
- Transcript
- Token usage
- Cost estimation
- User performance metrics

## 🚀 How It Works (Step-by-Step)

### 1. **Student Starts Call**
```
Student clicks "Start Call" → AISpeakingCall component mounts
→ Web Speech API initializes (continuous = true, interimResults = true)
→ Browser requests microphone permission
→ Recognition starts listening
→ callState → 'listening'
```

### 2. **Student Speaks**
```
Microphone captures audio
→ Web Speech API processes (real-time)
→ Interim results stream in (livePartial UI updates)
→ Student sees typing effect as they speak
```

### 3. **Speech Recognition Ends (Silence or Final Result)**
```
Web Speech API detects silence
→ Calls onresult with isFinal = true
→ Full transcript extracted: "Hello, I want to practice speaking"
→ handleStudentTranscript() triggered
→ callState → 'thinking'
```

### 4. **Gemini Analyzes & Coaches (Parallel)**
```
SIMULTANEOUS EXECUTION:
├─ Gemini Call 1 (Coaching)
│  Input: transcript + conversation history
│  Output: "Great! Try emphasizing 'PrACtice' to improve stress patterns."
│
└─ Gemini Call 2 (Pronunciation Analysis)
   Input: student transcript + IELTS criteria
   Output: { score: 7, feedback: "Clear delivery, work on word stress" }
```

### 5. **Generate Speech (TTS)**
```
AI coaching response → Google Cloud TTS
→ Returns base64 MP3 audio
→ Audio element src = data:audio/mp3;base64,...
→ Browser plays audio
→ callState → 'speaking'
```

### 6. **Resume Listening (Auto-Restart)**
```
Audio playback finishes
→ onended callback triggers
→ Web Speech API starts again (continuous mode)
→ callState → 'listening'
→ Loop returns to Step 2
```

### 7. **Error Handling & Fallback**
```
If Web Speech API errors:
├─ 'no-speech' → Auto-restart after 500ms
├─ 'network' → Switch to Google Cloud Speech mode
└─ Other → Show error toast, return to idle

If Google Cloud needed:
→ Audio stream over WebSocket
→ Real-time transcription
→ Same coaching logic continues
```

## 🎤 Real-Time Features

### What Makes This "Simultaneous Calling"

**Not Just Batch Processing:**
- ❌ Old: Upload audio → Wait for analysis
- ✅ New: Speaking → Instant coaching feedback

**Simultaneous Means:**
1. **Student speaks** → Audio captured in real-time
2. **AI listens & analyzes** → Gemini processes simultaneously
3. **AI responds** → TTS generates speech while student finishes
4. **Continuous loop** → Conversation flows naturally

### Pronunciation Analysis Real-Time:
```
Student: "I think education is important"
    ↓
[ed-yoo-KAY-shun] ← Web Speech captures
    ↓
Gemini analyzes:
- "education" stress on wrong syllable (should be: ed-joo-KAY-shun)
- Good intonation on overall sentence
- Clear pronunciation of consonants
    ↓
AI Tutora responds: "Nice clarity! Just remember 'education' 
                    stresses the 3rd syllable: ed-joo-KAY-shun."
    ↓
Student can immediately try again
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Supabase Edge Function Environment Variables:
```bash
GEMINI_API_KEY          # Google Gemini API key
GOOGLE_CLOUD_API_KEY    # Google Cloud API key (TTS + Speech)
SUPABASE_URL            # Supabase project URL
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY  # Service role key for logging
```

### Browser Web Speech Configuration:
```typescript
recognition.continuous = true;      // Keep listening after silence
recognition.interimResults = true;  // Show partial results
recognition.language = 'en-US';    // English (US)
recognition.maxAlternatives = 1;   // Single best result
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Speech recognition starts then immediately stops"

**Cause:** Web Speech API timeout or permission issue

**Solution (Already Implemented):**
1. ✅ Set `continuous = true`
2. ✅ Auto-restart on `onend` event
3. ✅ Graceful handling of `no-speech` errors
4. ✅ Fallback to Google Cloud Speech

### Problem: "Pronunciation feedback not showing"

**Cause:** Gemini pronunciation call failed silently

**Solution:**
- Check debug logs in UI
- Verify GEMINI_API_KEY is set
- Ensure JSON parsing handles markdown fences

### Problem: "Audio plays but AI doesn't respond"

**Cause:** TTS function error or audio encoding issue

**Solution:**
- Check base64 encoding
- Verify Google Cloud TTS API key
- Ensure audio element has `crossOrigin` attribute if needed

- [ ] Mobile browsers: Tested and working

---

## 📈 Scaling Considerations

### Current Limitations:
- Single user per session
- No multi-turn conversation history in future
- No pronunciation scoring persistence

### Future Improvements:
1. **Session history** → Store conversations for review
2. **Admin prompt management** → Customize coaching prompts
3. **Performance analytics** → Track student progress over time
4. **Accent-specific coaching** → Different strategies per accent
5. **IELTS band practice** → Target specific band scores
