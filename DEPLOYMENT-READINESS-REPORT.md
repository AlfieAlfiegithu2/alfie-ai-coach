## 🎯 WHAT YOU NEED TO DO NEXT

### STEP 1: Provide Supabase Credentials (5 minutes)
You have 2 options:

**Option A: Send me directly** (faster for me to execute)
1. Go to: https://app.supabase.com/projects
2. Select your project
3. Go to: Settings → API
4. Copy:
   - Project URL (e.g., https://abc123.supabase.co)
   - Anon Public Key (looks like a JWT)
5. Send to me here

**Option B: Configure yourself**
1. Update: `apps/earthworm/apps/api/.env`
2. Add:
   ```
   SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
   SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your-anon-key-here
   ENABLE_SUPABASE_AUTH=false
   ```

### STEP 2: Choose Deployment Target (10 minutes)
For Phase 7 deployment, you'll need to choose:

**Container Registry** (where to store Docker images):
- [ ] Docker Hub (docker.io)
- [ ] Azure Container Registry (ACR)
- [ ] Amazon ECR
- [ ] GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)
- [ ] Other: ___

**Production Infrastructure**:
- [ ] AWS EC2 / ECS / EKS
- [ ] Azure VMs / AKS
- [ ] DigitalOcean / Linode
- [ ] Existing on-premises servers
- [ ] Other: ___

### STEP 3: SSL Certificates (needed for HTTPS)
- [ ] Do you have SSL certificates already?
- [ ] Or should I generate self-signed certs for testing?

## 🚀 IF YOU PROVIDE SUPABASE CREDENTIALS

I can immediately execute:

### ✅ I CAN DO:

1. **Configure Earthworm locally**
   - Set up .env with your credentials
   - Verify Supabase connection works
   - Test token validation

2. **Run Phase 6 Tests Locally**
   - Start all services (docker-compose up)
   - Test SSO flow
   - Verify progress tracking
   - Check all 23 languages
   - Run performance checks

3. **Generate Deployment Artifacts**
   - Build production Docker images
   - Create docker-compose.prod.yml
   - Generate nginx.prod.conf
   - Create deployment checklist

4. **Deployment Preparation**
   - Verify builds complete
   - Check image sizes
   - Generate registry commands
   - Create deployment script

### ❌ YOU NEED TO DO:

1. **Push Docker Images**
   - I'll generate the push commands
   - You execute: `docker push your-registry/...`
   - Requires: Container registry access

2. **Deploy to Production**
   - I'll provide deployment commands
   - You execute on your production server
   - Requires: Server SSH access

3. **Monitor in Production**
   - Set up monitoring
   - Configure log aggregation
   - Set up alerts
