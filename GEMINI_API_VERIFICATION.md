## 📊 Why Only 4 Voices Initially?

The original 4 voices (Kore, Puck, Zephyr, Charon) were:
- ❓ A starting point to test the implementation
- ❓ Selected as most diverse personality types
- ❓ Not aware that Gemini supports all 30 voices

**Now:** All 30 official voices are available for selection!

---

## 🚀 How It Works Now

### Voice Selection Flow:
```
1. User opens AI Speaking Tutor page
   ↓
2. Sees dropdown with ALL 30 voices (organized by category)
   ↓
3. Selects preferred voice
   ↓
4. Clicks "Start Call"
   ↓
5. AI plays greeting using Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview TTS with selected voice
   ↓
6. Auto-starts listening for student speech
   ↓
7. Conversation continues with same voice throughout session
```

### Voice Request:
```typescript
const ttsRes = await supabase.functions.invoke('gemini-tts-speech', {
  body: {
    text: "Hello! I'm English Tutora, your IELTS Speaking coach.",
    voice: selectedVoice // Now can be ANY of the 30 voices
  }
});
```

## 🧪 Testing Recommendations

### Test 1: Voice Variety
- [ ] Select "Puck" (upbeat) - should sound friendly
- [ ] End call and select "Charon" (informative) - should sound formal
- [ ] Select "Enceladus" (breathy) - should sound soft
- [ ] Notice the personality difference in greeting

### Test 2: User Preference
- [ ] IELTS student → try "Kore" (professional, matches exam)
- [ ] Young learner → try "Puck" (friendly, encouraging)
- [ ] Pronunciation focus → try "Zephyr" (clear articulation)

### Test 3: API Reliability
- [ ] Make 5+ calls with different voices
- [ ] Verify audio plays consistently
- [ ] Check for any latency issues
- [ ] All 30 voices should work

## 📋 Implementation Details

### File Updated:
- `apps/main/src/pages/AISpeakingCall.tsx` (lines 28-85)

### Changes:
1. Updated `selectedVoice` state to accept 30 voice types
2. Expanded `AVAILABLE_VOICES` array with all 30 voices
