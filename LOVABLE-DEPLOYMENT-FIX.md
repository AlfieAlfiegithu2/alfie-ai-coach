# üöÄ Lovable Deployment Fix - October 21, 2025

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Issues Fixed on Localhost (5173)
- **Root Cause**: Vite cache issue with missing component resolution
- **Fix Applied**: 
  - Cleared Vite cache (`rm -rf apps/main/node_modules/.vite`)
  - Restarted dev servers using START-DEV-SERVERS.sh
  - Server now running successfully at localhost:5173

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Lovable Still Showing Old Version
- **Issue**: Lovable still displays "Collocation Connect" instead of "Sentence Mastery"
- **Root Cause**: Lovable is either:
  1. Not yet pulled the latest changes from GitHub
  2. Using cached deployment from an older commit
  3. Still building from a feature branch instead of main

### ‚úÖ GitHub Status
- Latest commit: `1934530` - Remove duplicate useEarthwormAuth.ts file
- All changes are on `main` branch
- Skills array correctly has "Sentence Mastery"
- Branch is up to date with origin/main

## What Changed

### Code Changes on GitHub:
1. ‚úÖ `apps/main/src/lib/skills.ts` - Updated to use "Sentence Mastery"
2. ‚úÖ `apps/main/src/pages/IELTSPortal.tsx` - Sentence Mastery click handler implemented
3. ‚úÖ `apps/main/src/hooks/useSentenceMasteryAuth.ts` - Created and working
4. ‚úÖ `apps/main/src/pages/SentenceMastery.tsx` - Route created
5. ‚úÖ `apps/main/src/App.tsx` - Route added for `/sentence-mastery`
6. ‚úÖ Removed duplicate `useEarthwormAuth.ts` file
