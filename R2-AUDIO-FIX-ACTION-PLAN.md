# R2 Audio Upload Fix - Action Plan

## Your Concern Was Right ‚úÖ
"When you just use supabase, the egress will be enormous, right? That's why I changed to cloudflare"

**YES - You were absolutely correct!**
- Supabase egress: $0.12/GB üí∞üí∞üí∞
- Cloudflare R2 egress: $0.015/GB after 10GB free üí∞
- **Savings: ~90%**

## What's Wrong With Your R2 Setup

1. **Account ID Mismatch**
   - Old files point to: `9c1c9b4e737b4f39253c796e831c5f0a` (wrong)
   - New files should point to: `9c1c9b4e737b4f39253c796e831e8382` (correct)
   - **Fix:** Update database with SQL script

2. **CORS Not Configured**
   - Browsers can't access files
   - Getting 403/timeout errors
   - **Fix:** Configure CORS in Cloudflare R2 settings

3. **Public Domain Not Working**
   - r2.dev domain assigned but not accessible
   - **Fix:** Verify domain setup or use custom domain

## 3-Step Fix (You Do This)

### Step 1: Fix Database URLs (5 minutes)
```sql
-- Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí SQL Editor
-- Paste this SQL and run:

UPDATE speaking_prompts
SET audio_url = REPLACE(
  audio_url,
  'alfie-ai-audio.9c1c9b4e737b4f39253c796e831c5f0a.r2.dev',
  'alfie-ai-audio.9c1c9b4e737b4f39253c796e831e8382.r2.dev'
)
WHERE audio_url LIKE '%9c1c9b4e737b4f39253c796e831c5f0a%';
```

### Step 2: Configure CORS in Cloudflare (10 minutes)
1. Log into Cloudflare Dashboard
2. Go to **R2 ‚Üí alfie-ai-audio**
3. Click **Settings**
4. Find **CORS Rules**
5. Add this JSON configuration:
```json

  "AllowedOrigins": [
    "http://localhost:5173",
    "http://localhost:3000",
    "https://englishaidol.com",
    "https://*.englishaidol.com"
  ],
  "AllowedMethods": ["GET", "HEAD", "PUT", "POST", "DELETE"],
  "AllowedHeaders": ["*"],
  "ExposeHeaders": ["ETag", "x-amz-version-id"],
  "MaxAgeSeconds": 3000
}
```
6. Click **Save**
