# ‚úÖ AI Speaking Tutor Navigation Fix - Complete

## Date: October 25, 2025

### Problem Found
The AI Speaking Tutor was being replaced with "Sentence Mastery" in the navigation, and clicking it would navigate to `/earthworm` which didn't exist.

### Root Causes Identified

1. **Header Navigation**
   - Button label was "Sentence Mastery" instead of "AI Speaking Coach"
   - Navigation path was `/earthworm` instead of `/speaking-tutor`
   - This issue existed in BOTH desktop AND mobile navigation

2. **Missing Route**
   - The `/speaking-tutor` route was NOT defined in `App.tsx`
   - No SpeakingTutor import in `App.tsx`
   - Clicking the button would result in 404 (Not Found)

### Fixes Applied

#### Fix 1: Updated Header Navigation (Desktop)
**File:** `apps/main/src/components/Header.tsx` (Line 49-56)
- Changed button label from "Sentence Mastery" to "AI Speaking Coach"
- Changed navigation path from `/earthworm` to `/speaking-tutor`
- Updated translation key from `navigation.sentenceMastery` to `navigation.speakingTutor`

#### Fix 2: Updated Header Navigation (Mobile)
**File:** `apps/main/src/components/Header.tsx` (Line 129-137)
- Same changes applied to mobile menu
- Ensures consistency across all device sizes

#### Fix 3: Added SpeakingTutor Import
**File:** `apps/main/src/App.tsx` (Line 108)
- Added: `import SpeakingTutor from "./pages/SpeakingTutor";`
- Allows the component to be used in routes

#### Fix 4: Added /speaking-tutor Route
**File:** `apps/main/src/App.tsx` (Line 281)
- Added: `<Route path="/speaking-tutor" element={<SpeakingTutor />} />`
- Now `/speaking-tutor` correctly displays the SpeakingTutor component
- Route placed before the catch-all `*` route
