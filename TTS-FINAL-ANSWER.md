# TTS Provider Status: Final Answer

## Question: "Are you still using ElevenLabs? Not Google Cloud TTS?"

### Answer: YES, Currently Using **ElevenLabs** ‚úÖ

**Brief Status:**
- ‚úÖ **ElevenLabs is ACTIVE** (working correctly)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Google Cloud TTS tried but failed** (key format incompatible)
- üìä **Fallback working as intended**

---

## Why Google Cloud TTS Failed

Your Google API key (`AIzaSyAN_...`) is from **Google AI Studio**, designed ONLY for:
- ‚úÖ Gemini models (conversation)
- ‚úÖ Gemini 2.5 Flash
- ‚ùå Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API

**The Issue:**
- AI Studio keys have LIMITED PERMISSIONS
- They cannot access Google Cloud TTS service
- Attempted to use it anyway ‚Üí Failed ‚Üí Fell back to ElevenLabs ‚úÖ

**Result:** ElevenLabs is still being used (your fallback)

2. Create a Google Cloud Project
3. Enable "Cloud Text-to-Speech API"
4. Create a Service Account
5. Create a JSON key with TTS permissions
6. Set: `npx supabase secrets set GOOGLE_CLOUD_TTS_API_KEY="<service-account-key>"`
