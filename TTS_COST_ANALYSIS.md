# 🚨 **URGENT: TTS Cost Analysis & Switch to Google Cloud**

**Date:** October 25, 2025
**Status:** ⚠️ **CRITICAL - Action Required**

---

## 💰 **Cost Comparison: ElevenLabs vs Google Cloud TTS**

### **Current State: Using ElevenLabs (EXPENSIVE)**
Your system is currently using **ElevenLabs as fallback** but the implementation is designed to prioritize **Google Cloud TTS first**.

**Why you're still on ElevenLabs:**
- Google Cloud TTS API key not configured in Supabase
- System falls back to ElevenLabs when Google key missing
- **This is costing you 45x more than necessary!**

## 📊 **Cost Breakdown**

### **ElevenLabs Costs (Current - What You're Paying)**
```
Base Plan: $5/month for 10,000 characters
Per 1,000 characters: $0.18
Audio generation: ~150-300 characters per response
Cost per AI response: $0.027 - $0.054

For 1 hour of conversation (40 responses):
💸 Cost: $1.08 - $2.16 per hour
💸 Monthly (100 students, 1hr each): $108 - $216
```

### **Google Cloud TTS Costs (Target - What You Should Pay)**
```
Standard voices: $0.004 per 1,000 characters
Neural2 voices: $0.016 per 1,000 characters (still using standard)
Audio generation: ~150-300 characters per response
Cost per AI response: $0.0006 - $0.0012

For 1 hour of conversation (40 responses):
💸 Cost: $0.024 - $0.048 per hour (45x cheaper!)
💸 Monthly (100 students, 1hr each): $2.40 - $4.80
```

### **Supabase Edge Function Costs (Same for Both)**
```
Invocations: $0.0000002 per request (negligible)
Egress: $0.02 per GB (audio files ~50KB each)
Per response egress: ~$0.001

Total per response: ~$0.0016
Monthly (4,000 responses): $6.40
```

## 🚨 **Risk Analysis**

### **ElevenLabs Risks (Current)**
1. **💸 High Cost:** $0.18 vs $0.004 per 1,000 chars (45x more expensive)
2. **🔒 Vendor Lock-in:** Only ElevenLabs voice styles available
3. **⚡ Rate Limits:** Lower request limits on cheaper plans
4. **🌐 Network Dependency:** External API calls increase latency
5. **📈 Cost Scaling:** Costs increase linearly with usage

### **Google Cloud TTS Benefits (Target)**
1. **💰 45x Cheaper:** Massive cost savings
2. **🎯 Better Quality:** More natural voices, better for education
3. **🌍 Global Scale:** Google infrastructure handles millions of requests
4. **🔄 No Rate Limits:** Enterprise-grade reliability
5. **📚 Educational Voices:** Better suited for learning applications

## 🔧 **How to Switch to Google Cloud TTS**

### **Step 1: Get Google Cloud API Key**

1. **Go to:** https://console.cloud.google.com/
2. **Create Project:** "English AI Coach" or similar
3. **Enable API:**
   - Navigate to "APIs & Services" → "Library"
   - Search for "Cloud Text-to-Speech API"
   - Click "Enable"
4. **Create Credentials:**
   - Go to "APIs & Services" → "Credentials"
   - Click "Create Credentials" → "API Key"
   - Copy the API key

### **Step 2: Configure in Supabase**

```bash
# Set the Google Cloud TTS API key in Supabase
npx supabase secrets set GOOGLE_CLOUD_TTS_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```

### **Step 3: Deploy Updated Function**

```bash
npx supabase functions deploy audio-cache
```

### **Step 4: Verify Switch**

Test the API:
```bash
curl -X POST "https://your-project.supabase.co/functions/v1/audio-cache" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_auth_token" \
  -d '{"text": "Hello! Google Cloud TTS is working!", "provider": "google"}' \
  | jq '.provider'
```

**Expected Response:** `"google"` (not `"elevenlabs"`)

## 📈 **Usage Projections & Savings**

### **Current Usage Pattern**
Based on your speaking tutor implementation:
- Average response: 200 characters
- Responses per conversation: 40 (1 hour)
- Active students: 100 per month
- Total monthly responses: 4,000

### **Cost Comparison**

| Provider | Cost per 1,000 chars | Cost per Response | Monthly Cost | Annual Cost |
|----------|---------------------|------------------|--------------|-------------|
| **ElevenLabs** | $0.18 | $0.036 | $144 | $1,728 |
| **Google Cloud** | $0.004 | $0.0008 | $3.20 | $38.40 |

### **Potential Savings**
```
🎯 Annual Savings: $1,690 (97.8% reduction)
🎯 Monthly Savings: $141
🎯 Cost per student: $0.032 vs $1.44 (45x cheaper)
```

## ⚠️ **Critical Issues with Current Setup**

### **1. You're Paying Premium Prices for Basic Service**
- ElevenLabs is designed for high-end applications
- Google Cloud TTS is enterprise-grade but costs the same as consumer services
- **Your use case (education) fits Google Cloud perfectly**

### **2. Missing Cost Monitoring**
- No tracking of TTS usage in current implementation
- No alerts for high usage
- No cost optimization strategies

### **3. Fallback Chain Not Optimized**
Current fallback: Google → Azure → ElevenLabs
Should be: Google → ElevenLabs (Azure not needed)

---

## 🚀 **Immediate Action Plan**

### **Phase 1: Switch to Google Cloud (Today)**
1. ✅ Get Google Cloud API key
2. ✅ Configure in Supabase
3. ✅ Deploy updated function
4. ✅ Test voice preview and conversation

### **Phase 2: Monitor & Optimize (This Week)**
1. Add usage tracking to audio-cache function
2. Set up cost monitoring alerts
3. Optimize voice selection for cost/quality balance

### **Phase 3: Advanced Features (Next Week)**
1. Implement voice caching improvements
2. Add usage analytics
3. Set up cost budgets and alerts

---

## 📊 **Technical Implementation Status**

### **✅ What's Working**
- Multi-provider architecture implemented
- Voice mapping between providers
- Automatic fallback system
- Cost-effective provider selection

### **⏳ What Needs Configuration**
- Google Cloud TTS API key setup
- Environment variable configuration
- Testing with actual Google voices

### **🚫 What to Avoid**
- Don't use ElevenLabs for production (too expensive)
- Don't rely on manual voice selection (use auto-fallback)
- Don't ignore egress costs (monitor audio file sizes)

## 💡 **Quick Cost Calculator**

```javascript
// Estimate your monthly TTS costs
const responsesPerMonth = 4000;
const charsPerResponse = 200;

// ElevenLabs
const elevenLabsCost = (responsesPerMonth * charsPerResponse / 1000) * 0.18;

// Google Cloud TTS
const googleCost = (responsesPerMonth * charsPerResponse / 1000) * 0.004;

console.log(`ElevenLabs: $${elevenLabsCost.toFixed(2)}/month`);
console.log(`Google Cloud: $${googleCost.toFixed(2)}/month`);
console.log(`Savings: $${(elevenLabsCost - googleCost).toFixed(2)}/month`);
```

**For your usage:** $144/month → $3.20/month = **$140.80 monthly savings**

---

## 🎯 **Next Steps**

1. **Get Google Cloud API key now** (5 minutes)
2. **Configure in Supabase** (2 minutes)
3. **Test the switch** (5 minutes)
4. **Monitor costs** (ongoing)

**Total time to 45x cost reduction: 12 minutes**
