      {
        "q": "Why should I trust an AI built by IELTS examiners?",
        "a": "Because it's not just AI—it's IELTS examiners' methodology in code. Our team includes former IELTS examiners who literally graded thousands of real exams. They didn't train a generic algorithm; they encoded their 15+ years of expertise: how to identify Task Achievement, spot coherence gaps, catch grammar patterns. Every scoring rule mirrors what examiners look for. You're practicing against the minds who created the test."
      },
      {
        "q": "Is your AI 98% accurate because it cheats or because it's actually good?",
        "a": "It's good because IELTS examiners built it. The 98% correlation isn't luck—it's that blind studies comparing our scores to official IELTS results show near-perfect alignment. Why? Because an actual examiner decided the algorithm's logic, not a data scientist guessing. We don't use black-box AI; we use transparent, rule-based scoring that examiners approved. You can request an explanation for any score—see exactly why you lost 0.5 bands on Coherence."
      },
      {
        "q": "What makes your AI different from Grammarly or ChatGPT feedback?",
        "a": "Grammarly flags grammar; ChatGPT generates. We *score*—like an examiner. Grammarly says 'comma needed.' We say 'You scored 6.5 on Lexical Range because you used 'good/bad' instead of 'beneficial/detrimental' in an academic essay.' ChatGPT rewords sentences. We explain your band score and exactly how to hit 7.0. Our AI was trained by people who *assign* IELTS bands, not by people who write essays or spot typos."
      },
      {
        "q": "Can an AI truly replace an examiner for practice?",
        "a": "For practice? Yes—better than most tutors, actually. Why? Consistency. A tutor marks 20 essays and gets tired; scores drift. Our AI marks 1,000 essays with identical standards. A tutor marks an essay 7.0 on one day, 6.5 on another. Our AI always applies the same rubric. For *feedback quality*, you get the rubric instantly + explanations. For *reliability*, an examiner-built system beats subjective humans. But—use it for practice scoring; use a human tutor for brainstorming and creative ideas."
