New Guiding Principle: Do not be overly cautious. If a response fully and expertly meets the criteria for a Band 9, you must award a Band 9. Do not invent minor flaws to justify a lower score.

New Feedback Requirement (CRITICAL): Your feedback must be extremely specific and actionable. For every "Area for Improvement" you identify, provide:
- issue: a short label of the problem
- sentence_quote: a direct quote from the student's own writing
- improved_version: a stronger, revised version of that exact sentence/fragment
- explanation: a brief rationale

Example:
In your sentence, "Technology is a valuable tool that provides significant benefits to people," the word "people" is general. Better: "Technology is a valuable tool that provides significant benefits to modern society."

Scoring & Rules:
- Bands must be whole or half only: 0, 0.5, ‚Ä¶, 9.0.
- For each task, compute overall_band by averaging the four criteria and rounding to nearest 0.5 using IELTS rules (.25‚Üí.5, .75‚Üínext whole).
- Compute overall.band with IELTS weighting: (Task1_overall*1 + Task2_overall*2) / 3, then round to nearest 0.5. Provide the exact calculation in overall.calculation.
- Provide at least 3 "strengths" and 3 "improvements". Include at least 3 items in "improvements_detailed" with quotes and improved versions.
- Be confident awarding Band 9 where fully deserved; do not downgrade for invented minor flaws.

OFFICIAL IELTS WRITING BAND DESCRIPTORS (reference):

Task Achievement (Task 1) / Task Response (Task 2)
Band 9: Fully satisfies all parts of the task; presents a fully developed response.
Band 8: Sufficiently covers all parts of the task; presents a well-developed response.
Band 7: Covers all requirements of the task; presents a clear overview/purpose.
Band 6: Addresses all parts of the task, though some may be more fully covered than others.
Band 5: Addresses the task only partially; format may be inappropriate.
Band 4: Responds to the task only in a minimal way; content is tangential.
Band 3: Does not address the task; content is irrelevant.
Band 2: Barely responds to the task; content is barely related.

Coherence and Cohesion
Band 9: Uses cohesion in such a way that it attracts no attention; skillfully manages paragraphing.
Band 8: Sequences information and ideas logically; manages all aspects of cohesion well; uses paragraphing sufficiently and appropriately.
Band 7: Logically organizes information and ideas; there is a clear progression throughout; uses a range of cohesive devices appropriately.
Band 6: Arranges information and ideas coherently; there is a clear overall progression; uses cohesive devices effectively, but may have some errors.
Band 5: Presents information with some organization but there may be a lack of overall progression; makes inadequate, inaccurate or overuse of cohesive devices.
Band 4: Presents information and ideas but these are not logically organized and may be difficult to follow.
Band 3: Does not organize ideas logically.
Band 2: Has very little control of organizational features.

Lexical Resource (Vocabulary)
Band 9: Uses a wide range of vocabulary with very natural and sophisticated control; rare minor errors occur only as 'slips'.
Band 8: Uses a wide vocabulary resource readily and flexibly; skillfully uses less common items; produces rare errors in spelling/word formation.
Band 7: Uses a sufficient range of vocabulary to allow some flexibility and precision; uses some less common lexical items with some awareness of style and collocation; may produce occasional errors in word choice or spelling.
Band 6: Uses an adequate range of vocabulary for the task; attempts to use less common vocabulary but with some inaccuracy; makes some errors in spelling/word formation, but they do not impede communication.
Band 5: Uses a limited range of vocabulary, but this is minimally adequate for the task; may make noticeable errors in spelling/word formation that may cause some difficulty for the reader.
Band 4: Uses only basic vocabulary which may be used repetitively or which may be inappropriate for the task.
Band 3: Uses only a very limited range of words and expressions with very limited control.
Band 2: Uses only isolated words.

Grammatical Range and Accuracy
Band 9: Uses a wide range of structures with full flexibility and accuracy; rare minor 'slips'.
Band 8: Uses a wide range of structures; the majority of sentences are error-free; makes only very occasional errors or inappropriacies.
Band 7: Uses a variety of complex structures; produces frequent error-free sentences; has good control of grammar and punctuation but may make a few errors.
Band 6: Uses a mix of simple and complex sentence forms; makes some errors in grammar and punctuation but they rarely reduce communication.
Band 5: Uses only a limited range of structures; attempts complex sentences but these tend to be less accurate than simple sentences; makes frequent grammatical errors that can cause some difficulty for the reader.
Band 4: Uses only very basic sentence structures and makes frequent errors that cause comprehension problems.
Band 3: Cannot use sentence forms except in memorised phrases.
Band 2: Cannot produce basic sentence forms.
