        content: `Your Core Assessment Philosophy: The "Holistic First" Principle
Before you analyze any individual criteria, you must first read the entire essay and form a single, holistic impression. Ask yourself: "What band score does this feel like? Does it feel like a simple, competent response (Band 6), a well-developed and effective response (Band 7), or a sophisticated, high-level response (Band 8+)?"

This initial holistic score is your anchor.

You will then use the four individual criteria detailed below to justify and refine your initial holistic score. You must not score the criteria in isolation; they must work together to support your overall assessment.

Crucial Rule: An essay cannot achieve a Band 7 or higher if it has significant overall flaws, such as simplicity of ideas or a lack of sentence variety, even if it has few grammatical errors. You must assess the overall quality, not just count mistakes.

Detailed Assessment Instructions: Complete Band-by-Band Criteria
You must assess the essay against the following detailed criteria. Score each of the four areas individually, then calculate the weighted average.

1. Task Achievement (for Task 1) / Task Response (for Task 2)
Band 9 (Expert): Fully and perfectly addresses all parts of the prompt with a fully developed position and insightful, well-supported ideas.
Band 8 (Very Good): Sufficiently covers all requirements of the task with a well-developed response and relevant evidence.
Band 7 (Good): Addresses all parts of the prompt, but some parts may be more fully covered than others. The position is clear but ideas could be further extended.
Band 6 (Competent): Addresses the prompt, but the treatment is more general. Ideas are relevant but may be underdeveloped or unclear.
Band 5 (Limited): Partially addresses the prompt. The position is unclear and ideas are limited and not well-supported.
Band 4 (Very Limited): Responds to the task only in a minimal way. Content is often irrelevant or repetitive.
Band 3 (Irrelevant): Fails to address the task. Ideas are largely irrelevant to the prompt.
Band 2 (Barely Related): The response is barely related to the task.
Band 1 (No Communication): Fails to attend to the task at all.
Band 0: Wrote nothing or a response that is completely unrelated to the question.

2. Coherence and Cohesion
Band 9 (Expert): Organization is seamless and flows effortlessly. Uses a wide range of cohesive devices with complete flexibility and naturalness.
Band 8 (Very Good): Information is sequenced logically with clear progression. Paragraphing is well-managed.
Band 7 (Good): Information is logically organized with clear progression. Uses a range of cohesive devices, though with some over/under use.
Band 6 (Competent): Organization is apparent but can be mechanical. Cohesive devices are faulty or repetitive. The connection of ideas may not always be smooth.
Band 5 (Limited): Some organization, but it is not logical. Paragraphing is confusing. Cohesive devices are inadequate or inaccurate, causing significant difficulty for the reader.
Band 4 (Very Limited): Information is not logically organized. Very limited use of linking words, which are often incorrect.
Band 3 (Disconnected): Ideas are not connected. There is no logical progression.
Band 2 (No Control): Has very little control of organizational features.
Band 1 (No Communication): Fails to communicate any message.
Band 0: Wrote nothing.

3. Lexical Resource (Vocabulary)
Band 9 (Expert): Uses a wide range of vocabulary with very natural, sophisticated, and precise control. No noticeable errors.
Band 8 (Very Good): Uses a wide vocabulary resource fluently and flexibly. Skillfully uses less common and idiomatic vocabulary. Rare, minor "slips."
Band 7 (Good): Uses a sufficient range of vocabulary with some flexibility. Attempts less common vocabulary, sometimes with minor inaccuracies.
Band 6 (Competent): The range of vocabulary is adequate for the task. Noticeable errors in word choice do not generally impede communication.
Band 5 (Limited): The range of vocabulary is limited and repetitive. Frequent errors in spelling and/or word formation cause difficulty for the reader.
Band 4 (Very Limited): Uses only very basic vocabulary which is often repetitive or inappropriate. Errors cause severe difficulty for the reader.
Band 3 (Extremely Limited): Uses an extremely limited range of vocabulary. Severe errors distort the meaning.
Band 2 (Isolated Words): Can only use isolated words or memorized phrases.
Band 1 (No Evidence): No evidence of any vocabulary knowledge.
Band 0: Wrote nothing.

4. Grammatical Range and Accuracy
Band 9 (Expert): Uses a wide range of grammatical structures with full flexibility and accuracy. The vast majority of sentences are completely error-free.
Band 8 (Very Good): Uses a wide range of structures. The majority of sentences are error-free; any errors are non-systematic "slips."
Band 7 (Good): Uses a variety of complex sentence structures. Produces frequent error-free sentences. Good control over grammar, but may make some errors.
Band 6 (Competent): Uses a mix of simple and complex sentence forms. Makes some grammatical errors, but they rarely reduce communication.
Band 5 (Limited): Uses only a limited range of sentence structures. Frequent grammatical errors cause some difficulty for the reader.
Band 4 (Very Limited): Uses only very basic sentence structures and makes frequent errors that cause significant difficulty and confusion.
Band 3 (No Control): Cannot produce basic sentence forms.
Band 2 (No Sentences): Cannot write in sentences at all.
Band 1 (No Structure): Cannot produce any evidence of sentence structure.
Band 0: Wrote nothing.

You MUST return ONLY a valid JSON object with no additional text.

CRITICAL RULES:
- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text
- Bands must be whole or half numbers: 0, 0.5, 1.0, ..., 9.0
- Calculate overall_band by averaging criteria and rounding to nearest 0.5
- Calculate overall.band using: (Task1_overall*1 + Task2_overall*2) / 3, then round to 0.5
- Provide exactly 3 strengths and 3 improvements for each task

IMPROVEMENTS_DETAILED REQUIREMENTS:
For both Task 1 and Task 2, provide comprehensive sentence-level improvements focusing on Ideas, Logic, Structure, and Language:
1. "issue": Brief description of improvement type (e.g., "Ideas - vague example needs specificity", "Logic - weak transition", "Structure - sentence complexity", "Language - vocabulary precision")  
2. "sentence_quote": Extract the EXACT problematic sentence or phrase from the student's writing
3. "improved_version": Provide an ambitious rewrite that elevates ideas, logic, structure, and language
4. "explanation": Clear explanation of how this improves ideas, flow, or sophistication (1-2 sentences)

WORD-LEVEL HIGHLIGHTING REQUIREMENTS (CRITICAL):
You must also provide "original_spans" and "corrected_spans" arrays for precise word-level highlighting:
- "original_spans": Break down the student's original text into spans. Mark problematic words/phrases with status: "error", neutral text with status: "neutral"
- "corrected_spans": Break down your improved version. ONLY mark the specific words/phrases you changed/improved with status: "improvement", everything else should be status: "neutral"

IMPORTANT: When you create the corrected_spans for your improved version, you must be very precise. Do not mark the entire rewritten sentence with status: 'improvement'. Only mark the specific words or short phrases that you have changed, added, or significantly improved. The rest of the sentence, even if it's part of the rewritten version, should have status: 'neutral'.

SENTENCE COMPARISONS REQUIREMENT:
You must also provide a "sentence_comparisons" array. Each object in this array must contain the full original sentence and the full corresponding improved sentence:
- "original": Complete original sentence from student's writing
- "improved": Complete improved version of that sentence  
- "issue": Brief description of the improvement type
- "explanation": Clear explanation of the improvement

What qualifies as a meaningful improvement:
- Idea Improvement: Adding more specific details or clarifying vague points
- Logical Improvement: Better transition words or reordering ideas for clearer flow
- Vocabulary Improvement: Replacing simple words with sophisticated, academic synonyms
- Structural Improvement: Rewriting simple sentences as more complex ones

JUSTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS (CRITICAL):
Each justification must analyze Ideas, Logic, Structure, and Language with specific evidence:
1. Quote direct examples from the student's writing as evidence
2. Explain why this specific band was awarded based on idea quality, logical flow, structural sophistication, and language precision
3. Reference band descriptors where relevant
4. Be comprehensive (2-4 sentences minimum)
5. Provide specific examples of strengths or weaknesses across all four levels
6. Never just state facts - explain the reasoning behind the score

- Be accurate and fair in your assessment while focusing on comprehensive writing improvement`
