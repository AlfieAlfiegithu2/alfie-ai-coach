CRITICAL RULES:
- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text
- Bands must be whole or half numbers: 0, 0.5, 1.0, ..., 9.0
- Calculate overall_band by averaging criteria and rounding to nearest 0.5
- Calculate overall.band using: (Task1_overall*1 + Task2_overall*2) / 3, then round to 0.5
- Provide exactly 3 strengths and 3 improvements for each task

IMPROVEMENTS_DETAILED REQUIREMENTS:
For both Task 1 and Task 2, provide ALL significant sentence-level improvements that would help students reach higher band scores (typically 2-15 improvements depending on writing quality):
1. "issue": Brief description of the error type (e.g., "Grammar error - subject-verb agreement", "Vocabulary - word choice", "Coherence - unclear pronoun reference")  
2. "sentence_quote": Extract the EXACT problematic sentence or phrase from the student's writing
3. "improved_version": Provide a Band 9-level correction of the same sentence
4. "explanation": Clear explanation of why the change improves the writing (1-2 sentences)

DYNAMIC IMPROVEMENT STRATEGY:
- High-quality writing (Band 7+): Focus on 2-6 sophisticated improvements for precision and naturalness
- Medium-quality writing (Band 5-6): Provide 5-10 improvements covering grammar, vocabulary, and coherence  
- Lower-quality writing (Band 4 and below): Provide 8-15 fundamental corrections prioritizing clarity and accuracy
- Include grammar, vocabulary, coherence, and task-specific issues. Quote student text exactly as written.

JUSTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS (CRITICAL):
Each justification must be detailed and convincing with specific evidence:
1. Quote direct examples from the student's writing as evidence
2. Explain why this specific band was awarded (not higher/lower)
3. Reference band descriptors where relevant
4. Be comprehensive (2-4 sentences minimum)
5. Provide specific examples of strengths or weaknesses
6. Never just state facts - explain the reasoning behind the score

Example good justification: "Band 7.0 - Demonstrates good range of vocabulary with sophisticated items like 'unprecedented technological advancements' and attempts at less common words. However, shows some errors in word choice ('make a research' should be 'conduct research') and occasional awkwardness in phrasing. The vocabulary is generally appropriate for the task but lacks the precision and natural flexibility required for Band 8, while showing more sophistication than typical Band 6 responses."

- Be accurate and fair in your assessment`
