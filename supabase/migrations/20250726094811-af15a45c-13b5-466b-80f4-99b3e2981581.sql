-- Part 2 Questions (Long Turn)
('Describe a Book', 'Describe a book you have read recently that you found interesting.

You have one minute to prepare and up to two minutes to speak.', 2, 120, '[]', 'I''d like to talk about a fascinating book I read recently called "Sapiens" by Yuval Noah Harari. This book explores the history of mankind from the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa to the present day, examining how we evolved from insignificant animals to the dominant species on Earth. I chose to read it because several friends recommended it, and I''ve always been curious about human evolution and history. The book taught me how three major revolutions - the Cognitive, Agricultural, and Scientific revolutions - fundamentally shaped human civilization. What I found most interesting was Harari''s ability to present complex historical concepts in an accessible way, making me reconsider many assumptions about progress and human nature.', '{"fluency": "Sustained speaking for 2 minutes with good pacing", "vocabulary": "Academic vocabulary and book-related terms", "grammar": "Past tenses for experiences, complex structures", "pronunciation": "Clear delivery of complex ideas"}'),

Petra is an archaeological wonder, famous for its rock-cut architecture and water conduit system. When I arrived, I was immediately struck by the dramatic entrance through the narrow gorge called the Siq, which opens up to reveal the iconic Treasury building carved directly into the pink sandstone cliffs. I spent the entire day exploring the vast site, hiking to the Monastery, visiting the Royal Tombs, and learning about the Nabataean civilization. What made this place so memorable was not just its breathtaking beauty, but the sense of walking through living history. Standing before these 2,000-year-old structures, I felt a profound connection to ancient civilizations and was amazed by human ingenuity and artistic achievement.', '{"fluency": "Extended discourse with good organization", "vocabulary": "Travel and historical vocabulary", "grammar": "Past narrative tenses and descriptive language", "pronunciation": "Appropriate stress and intonation for storytelling"}'),

You have one minute to prepare and up to two minutes to speak.', 2, 120, '[]', 'I''d like to talk about my high school mathematics teacher, Mrs. Chen, who has had a profound influence on my life and career path. I first met her when I was fifteen and struggling with algebra. Mrs. Chen was known for her patience and innovative teaching methods - she had a unique ability to break down complex mathematical concepts into understandable steps. Under her guidance, I not only improved my grades dramatically but also developed a genuine love for mathematics and logical thinking. Her influence extended beyond academics; she taught me the importance of perseverance and critical thinking. She always encouraged students to question, explore, and never give up when facing difficulties. Today, as I pursue a career in engineering, I often reflect on how her teaching philosophy shaped my approach to problem-solving. Mrs. Chen showed me that with the right guidance and determination, any challenge can be overcome, and this lesson has been invaluable throughout my academic and professional journey.', '{"fluency": "Personal anecdote with emotional connection", "vocabulary": "Educational and personal development terms", "grammar": "Past and present perfect for experiences and results", "pronunciation": "Emotional emphasis and clear storytelling"}'),

-- Part 3 Questions (Discussion)
('Education Discussion', 'Let''s discuss education in general. How do you think education will change in the future? What are the advantages and disadvantages of online learning? Do you think traditional classroom learning will become obsolete?', 3, 15, '["How important is it for students to learn practical skills versus theoretical knowledge?", "What role should technology play in education?", "How can education systems better prepare students for the modern workforce?"]', 'I believe education is undergoing a fundamental transformation. In the future, I expect we''ll see a more personalized, technology-integrated approach to learning. Online learning offers remarkable advantages like flexibility, accessibility, and cost-effectiveness - students can learn at their own pace and access resources globally. However, it also has significant disadvantages, particularly the lack of face-to-face interaction and hands-on experiences that are crucial for developing social skills and practical competencies. I don''t think traditional classroom learning will become completely obsolete, but rather evolve into a hybrid model. The future likely lies in blended learning, where technology enhances rather than replaces human interaction, combining the best of both worlds to create more effective educational experiences.', '{"fluency": "Abstract discussion with good argumentation", "vocabulary": "Educational and technological terminology", "grammar": "Future forms, conditionals, and complex structures", "pronunciation": "Clear articulation of complex ideas"}'),

('Technology Discussion', 'Let''s talk about technology and society. How has technology changed the way people communicate? Do you think social media has more positive or negative effects on society? What might be the long-term consequences of our increasing dependence on technology?', 3, 15, '["How do you think artificial intelligence will impact employment?", "Should there be more regulation of technology companies?", "How can we ensure technology benefits everyone in society?"]', 'Technology has revolutionized communication in unprecedented ways. We''ve moved from letters and phone calls to instant messaging, video calls, and social media platforms that enable global connectivity. While this has made communication faster and more accessible, it has also changed the nature of human interaction. Regarding social media, I believe it has both positive and negative effects. Positively, it connects people across distances, facilitates information sharing, and gives voice to marginalized communities. However, it also contributes to misinformation, social comparison, and reduced face-to-face interaction skills. The long-term consequences of our technology dependence are complex. While technology can enhance productivity and solve global challenges, over-reliance might lead to reduced critical thinking skills, privacy concerns, and increased social isolation. The key is finding a balance that harnesses technology''s benefits while preserving essential human elements of communication and social interaction.', '{"fluency": "Sophisticated discussion with balanced arguments", "vocabulary": "Advanced technology and society vocabulary", "grammar": "Complex sentence structures and abstract language", "pronunciation": "Appropriate pausing and emphasis for argumentation"}'),

('Environment Discussion', 'Let''s discuss environmental issues. What do you think are the most serious environmental problems facing the world today? How can individuals contribute to protecting the environment? Do you think governments are doing enough to address climate change?', 3, 15, '["How might climate change affect future generations?", "What role should businesses play in environmental protection?", "How can we balance economic development with environmental conservation?"]', 'I believe the most serious environmental challenges we face today include climate change, deforestation, plastic pollution, and biodiversity loss. These issues are interconnected and require urgent, coordinated action. Individuals can make meaningful contributions through lifestyle changes like reducing energy consumption, choosing sustainable transportation, minimizing waste, and making conscious purchasing decisions. However, while individual action is important, systemic change is crucial. Regarding government action, I think most governments are not doing enough. While some countries have made significant commitments to renewable energy and emissions reduction, the pace of change is often too slow given the urgency of the climate crisis. We need more ambitious policies, greater international cooperation, and substantial investment in green technologies. The challenge lies in balancing short-term economic interests with long-term environmental sustainability, but ultimately, the cost of inaction far exceeds the investment required for meaningful environmental protection.', '{"fluency": "Coherent argument with supporting evidence", "vocabulary": "Environmental and policy vocabulary", "grammar": "Conditional sentences and cause-effect language", "pronunciation": "Emphatic delivery of key points"}');
